## 🧠 Core Concepts Revisited

This segment blended **AI-driven game logic**, **C++11 move semantics**, and **object-oriented design** into one dense but conceptually rich checkpoint. I used this space to reflect on how decision trees and optimization patterns like Alpha-Beta pruning simulate intelligent behavior, while also studying the memory benefits of `std::move` and expression tree structures.

Key areas of focus:
- **C++11 Class Constructors & Move Semantics** – Avoiding deep copying using `std::move` and initializer lists  
- **AI Decision-Making with Min-Max Logic** – Simulating turn-based reasoning and pruning irrelevant move paths  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** – Enhancing Min-Max efficiency through conditional logic  
- **Inheritance for Expression Trees** – Parsing and evaluating prefix (Polish notation) expressions using abstract base classes  
- **No Deliverables** – Focused on theoretical design, memory optimization, and performance strategy

## 🪞 Reflection

This was one of the most concept-heavy but rewarding segments. I took time to sketch out inheritance trees and pseudocode for Min-Max logic in my notes. The AI portion challenged my systems thinking, and the move constructor section sharpened my understanding of memory efficiency. I walked away with clearer mental models of how inheritance, optimization, and resource transfer converge in C++ performance design.
