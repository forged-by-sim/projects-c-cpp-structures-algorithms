# 🧩 M2 – Hex Board Logic Using Graphs & Inheritance  
**Folder**: `c4-cpp-monte-carlo-hex-board/m2`  
**Focus**: Building a playable Hex board using graph logic, clean class structures, and OOP inheritance in C++

## 📌 Task: Implement Hex Game Board in C++

**Goal**:  
Construct a basic Hex game simulation by designing a C++ board structure that blends graph traversal logic with clean object-oriented inheritance. This task focused on turning abstract concepts—like node connection and board state tracking—into a modular, extensible system.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Wrote core board logic in `hex-board.cpp` to simulate the Hex game structure  
- Created a step-by-step plan in `task-breakdown-hex-board.txt` to clarify implementation logic  
- Used `prompt-implement-hex-board.txt` to reflect on my strategy and modular design choices  
- Applied inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation cleanly across board components  
- Debugged edge case behaviors (e.g. movement, connectivity) and validated correct gameplay simulation

## 🪞 Reflection

This was my first time integrating game logic with graph theory in C++. Designing a board that could be treated as a graph challenged me to think abstractly—especially around how board connections simulate node links. I was especially proud of how cleanly I used inheritance to extend base structures and enforce modularity. Writing breakdowns before coding helped me stay organized, and the final structure felt like a real leap forward in both game systems thinking and C++ design confidence.
