## 🧠 Core Concepts Revisited

This segment served as a mental warm-up, reconnecting key **graph theory principles** with modern **C++ STL constructs**. It emphasized how to represent graph structures using `std::vector`, `std::set`, and `std::pair`, while preparing the groundwork for dynamic graph simulation in later projects.

Key areas of focus:
- **Graph Theory Refresh** – Nodes, edges, adjacency lists, and graph traversal concepts  
- **C++ STL Containers** – Using `vector`, `set`, and `pair` to simulate relationships between graph components  
- **Efficient Traversals** – Laying the foundation for dynamic representations of graphs  
- **No Deliverables** – Learning was video- and concept-driven with no coding assignments

## 🪞 Reflection  

Although there were no assignments, this module helped me reconnect theoretical graph concepts with practical STL applications in C++. I enjoyed seeing how clean and modular the syntax could be when using iterators and pairs to construct adjacency models. It gave me the confidence to pursue a personal project—rebuilding a basic graph using `std::vector<std::set<int>>`.

📂 *Note:* No source files exist for this module. It was a conceptual checkpoint to revisit STL-based modeling of graphs using containers and prepare for hands-on simulation logic in future tasks.
