# 🎲 M4 – Monte Carlo Strategy for Hex Move Evaluation  
**Folder**: `c4-cpp-monte-carlo-hex-board/m4`  
**Focus**: Simulating Monte Carlo-based game logic with randomness, probability, and intelligent move evaluation using C++

⸻

## 📌 Task: Apply Monte Carlo Move Evaluation in C++

**Goal**:  
Implement a simplified Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate Hex moves intelligently. This task combined graph logic, randomness, weighted decision-making, and clean OOP design patterns into one cohesive system.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Created a full simulation engine in `interactive-hex-game.cpp` for Monte Carlo–style Hex logic  
- Used `prompt-implement-monte-carlo-hex-move-eval.txt` to reflect on move strategy, patterns, and logic  
- Outlined my implementation flow in `task-breakdown-implement-monte-carlo-hex-game.txt`  
- Modeled randomness, probability weighting, and inheritance patterns to simulate realistic gameplay  
- Focused on modularity, memory safety, and intelligent design choices throughout the code

## 🪞 Reflection

This was one of the most intellectually satisfying projects I’ve completed in C++. Writing a Monte Carlo Hex evaluator from scratch challenged me to synthesize randomness, probability, and clean logic into a smart, playable simulation. It was a true culmination of the design patterns and graph-based thinking I had built up to this point. I walked away from this project feeling like I earned my “for programmers” badge.
