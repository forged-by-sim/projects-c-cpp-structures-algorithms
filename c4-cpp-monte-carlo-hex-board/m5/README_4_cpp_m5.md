# 🧪 M5 – Final Simulation Assessment & Strategic Debugging  
**Folder**: `c4-cpp-monte-carlo-hex-board/m5`  
**Files**: `c4-practice.txt`, `c4_practice_thought_process.md`  
**Focus**: Synthesizing simulation logic, STL patterns, Monte Carlo techniques, and class-based design under final exam conditions

## 🎯 Task Overview  
This final task served as the **culminating challenge** of the C++ Monte Carlo Hex board series. Designed to simulate exam-style rigor, the objective was to demonstrate mastery over simulation construction, STL patterns, probabilistic reasoning, and optimization principles within C++.

All solutions were completed in `c4-practice.txt`, with expanded justifications and decision breakdowns in `c4_practice_thought_process.md`.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- Monte Carlo logic for board evaluation and outcome prediction  
- Class-based simulation structures with modular STL integration  
- Performance-based debugging and tradeoff analysis  
- Applying object-oriented reasoning under pressure  
- Building clean, testable code logic aligned with simulation outcomes

| `c4-practice.txt`                | Final exam-style responses with full implementation logic                   |
| `c4_practice_thought_process.md` | Annotated breakdown of strategy, evaluation patterns, and decision flows    |

Together, these documents demonstrate both theoretical clarity and applied logic mastery—delivered under timed, no-compiler constraints. It was the final proving ground for my fluency in simulation-heavy, performance-aware C++ workflows.
