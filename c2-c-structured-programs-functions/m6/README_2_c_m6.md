# 🧪 M6 – Practice Task: Final C Structured Programming Exam  
**Folder**: `c2-c-structured-programs-functions/m6`  
**Files**: `c2-practice.txt`, `c2_practice_thought_process.txt`  
**Focus**: Synthesizing key C programming skills including conditionals, modularity, struct logic, and error handling

## 🎯 Task Overview  
The practice tasks were modeled after earlier prompts, testing my understanding of structured program design, variable tracking, control flow, and defensive programming. 

I used `c2-practice.txt` to write solutions, and `c2_practice_thought_process.txt` to document logic breakdowns, catch errors, and reflect on decision-making. These tasks mirrored real-world test conditions—tight time, limited review windows, and the need for confident, justifiable code.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- Debugging with intent and line-by-line logic tracing  
- Designing clean control flow with loops and conditionals  
- Writing modular, readable C code under pressure  
- Using `assert()` and structured patterns for clarity  
- Justifying code choices and catching logic traps before submission

## 📁 File Notes  

| File Name                       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `c2-practice.txt`              | Final exam-style prompts with complete written responses     |
| `c2_practice_thought_process.txt` | Deep reasoning, error checks, and design logic reflections |

These files helped me prepare mentally and technically for the real exam. Practicing with this structure reinforced clean logic, strong naming habits, and confidence in debugging under pressure.
