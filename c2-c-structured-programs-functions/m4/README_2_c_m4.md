## 🧪 Projects Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Inorder Traversal with a Tree Data Structure  
Challenge: Simulate hierarchical node relationships and perform an inorder traversal.

🧠 What I Did:
- Wrote `build-tree-and-inorder-traversal.c` to create and traverse a binary tree  
- Used `tree-data.txt` to define nodes for construction  
- Confirmed output accuracy in `output-inorder-traversal.txt`  
- Documented my logic breakdown in `task-breakdown-binary-tree.txt`

---

### ✅ Task 2: Rational Array Operations from File Input  
Challenge: Read structured data from a file and perform arithmetic on rational numbers.

🧠 What I Did:
- Created `rational-array-operations-file-input.c` to parse and process rational values  
- Used `rational-data.txt` as structured input for test cases  
- Validated output in `sample-output-rationals.txt`  
- Reflected on design choices in `task-breakdown-rational-numbers.txt`

## 🪞 Reflection  
This project brought structure to structure. Trees and traversals helped me simulate layered relationships and practice control over node-based logic. Working with rational numbers via file input simulated real-world batch processing—more than just math, it was workflow logic. Each task showed how C can scale from static logic to input-driven systems.
