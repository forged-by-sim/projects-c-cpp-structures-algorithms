# 🧪 M5 – Practice Task: Introduction to C++ Concepts  
**Folder**: `c2-c-structured-programs-functions/m5`  
**File**: `w5-practice.txt`  
**Focus**: Comparing C and C++ syntax, understanding basic C++ program structure, and exploring object-oriented concepts at a high level  

⸻

## 🎯 Task Overview  
This practice task served as a **conceptual transition from C to C++**, focusing on syntax differences, program flow, and the motivations behind object-oriented design. Rather than implementing full C++ programs, this module emphasized understanding *why* C++ exists and *how* it builds on structured programming principles learned in C.

The work in `w5-practice.txt` captured reflections, comparisons, and conceptual reasoning to prepare for future C++ coursework.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- Differences between C and C++ syntax and program structure  
- Understanding basic C++ program flow  
- Introduction to classes as a way to encapsulate data and behavior  
- Comparing procedural programming (C) with object-oriented thinking (C++)  
- Recognizing how C foundations translate naturally into C++ concepts

## 📁 File Notes  

This file (`w5-practice.txt`) contains conceptual notes and reflections on the transition from C to C++. While no executable code was produced, the exercise reinforced how structured programming principles scale into object-oriented design. It served as a mental bridge between languages and clarified the learning path ahead.
