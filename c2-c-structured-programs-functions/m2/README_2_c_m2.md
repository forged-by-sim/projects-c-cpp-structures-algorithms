# 🧩 M2 – Structs, Simulations & Monte Carlo Logic  
**Folder**: `c2-c-structured-programs-functions/m2`  
**Focus**: Grouping data using `struct`, seeding randomness with `srand()` and `rand()`, and modeling probabilistic systems using Monte Carlo simulations

## 🧪 Projects Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Struct-Based Employee Generator  
Challenge: Create a program that models an employee profile using a `struct`.

🧠 What I Did:
- Defined a `struct` with fields for name, ID, and salary  
- Implemented logic in `employee-generator.c`  
- Planned out the logic in `prompt-employee-generator.txt`  
- Practiced abstraction and modularity using structured data types

---

### ✅ Task 2: Monte Carlo Poker Simulation  
Challenge: Simulate a poker experiment using randomized logic and track outcome frequencies.

🧠 What I Did:
- Wrote `monte-carlo-poker-simulation.c` to simulate repeated trials  
- Used `months.c` as a data source to seed randomness  
- Logged and visualized outcomes in `probabilities_table.png`  
- Reflected on simulation logic in `prompt-probabilities.txt`

---

### ✅ Task 3: Struct Design & Planning  
Challenge: Practice how to model and apply structured data through guided prompts.

🧠 What I Did:
- Sketched struct designs in `prompt-using-struct.txt`  
- Broke down the logic of grouping related data types  
- Used prompts to clarify the benefits of struct-based organization

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- Defining and applying `struct` for modular C programs  
- Seeding randomness and using `rand()`/`srand()` for simulated logic  
- Running Monte Carlo experiments with loop iterations  
- Formatting and visualizing simulation output  
- Separating logic planning from code execution

## 🪞 Reflection  
This project has helped me think structurally—literally. Using `struct` taught me to treat data as cohesive units, while the Monte Carlo simulation showed how randomness could be shaped into insight. Each experiment felt like a mini-lab where logic and chance worked together. I now feel more confident building simulations that reflect messy, real-world conditions with clean, modular code.
