## 🧪 Projects Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Atomic Elements Using Structs  
Challenge: Create and store atomic element data using `struct` and simulate sample outputs.

🧠 What I Did:
- Implemented `general.c` to define a struct representing element fields (name, number, mass)  
- Designed sample data in `10-atomic-elements-stored-as-linked-list.c`  
- Created guiding logic in `step-by-step-plan-for-struct-of-atoms.txt`  
- Generated mock outputs in `sample-output-atomic-elements.txt`  
- Explored structure design through `prompt-atomic-elements.txt`

---

### ✅ Task 2: Doubly Linked List with Duplicate Removal  
Challenge: Build a doubly linked list that stores atomic data and removes duplicates during insertion.

🧠 What I Did:
- Built `doubly-linked-list-with-duplicate-removal-via-sorting.c` to test list operations  
- Broke down logic in `task-breakdown-doubly-linked.txt`  
- Used `struct_to_store_atomic_elements.png` to visualize memory layout  
- Documented thought process in `prompt-singly-linked-list-to-doubly-linked-list.txt`

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- Layering data with `struct` to model scientific entities  
- Implementing and managing doubly linked lists in C  
- Insertion-time duplicate detection with pointer manipulation  
- Using visual aids to map structure memory layout  
- Separating assignment logic from experiment planning

## 🪞 Reflection  
This project stretched my understanding of abstraction and memory control. I wasn’t just storing values — I was managing structured entities like atomic elements and ensuring logical consistency using pointer-based operations. The duplicate-removal list pushed my debugging and logic design skills, while the struct work helped me see how data modeling and simulation go hand-in-hand in scientific computing.
