# 🧰 C Structured Programs & Functions  
**Folder**: `c2-c-structured-programs-functions`  
**Focus**: Modular C programming, memory-aware logic, data flow, and simulation-style program design  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This project focused on building structured C programs that were **modular, readable, and reusable**. I moved beyond solving isolated problems to designing workflows with input/output control, structured data, and logical branching. Every script pushed me to think like a systems programmer — planning memory usage, breaking logic into clean blocks, and documenting my decisions.

Key topics explored:
- Breaking programs into separate `.c` files and functions  
- Modeling real-world data with `struct`  
- File handling with `fopen()`, `fgets()`, `fprintf()`  
- Looping and conditional decision-making  
- Debugging with `assert()` and tracing logic edge cases  
- Organizing dynamic simulations using arrays, trees, and linked lists

## 🛠️ Featured Tasks  

✅ Simulated employee profiles using custom data types  
✅ Built a Monte Carlo poker simulation with randomized input  
✅ Created a doubly linked list to track atomic elements and remove duplicates  
✅ Designed a binary tree structure for inorder traversal  
✅ Handled file-based rational number calculations  
✅ Practiced explaining logic in plain text alongside code  
✅ Closed out the project with a logic-driven written exam and structured review

🧠 Each subfolder (`m1`–`m6`) includes:
- Task prompts and planning files  
- `.c` source code with inline comments  
- Output files for results and validation  
- Reflections showing logic, reasoning, and debugging steps

## 💡 Reflection  
This project taught me how to **design** in C, not just code in it. Every decision mattered — from memory layout to loop boundaries. I learned to simulate logic, manage structured data, and debug with confidence. By the end, I was writing C like a systems developer: clean, defensive, modular. This foundation will carry into my C++, XR, and simulation work going forward.
