# 🧪 M1 – Practice Task: Enums, Preprocessors & Defensive Logic  
**Folder**: `c2-c-structured-programs-functions/m1`  
**File**: `w1-practice.txt`  
**Focus**: Practicing symbolic constants using `enum`, compile-time macros with `#define`, and runtime checks with `assert()`

⸻

## 🎯 Task Overview  
This practice task focused on **key C language features** used to write modular and defensive code. I explored how to improve readability using `enum`, simplify repeated values using `#define`, and prevent logic errors with runtime assertions (`assert()`). The goal was to internalize clean programming habits before moving into more complex modules.

The task was completed in `w1-practice.txt` and included quiz-style reasoning, conceptual breakdowns, and handwritten planning notes.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- Creating symbolic constants using `enum`  
- Writing preprocessor macros using `#define`  
- Including external code with `#include`  
- Using `assert()` to enforce runtime conditions  
- Clarifying logic and code intention with defensive structures

## 📁 File Notes  

This file (`w1-practice.txt`) contains my early reflections and practice examples that helped build familiarity with modular logic and reinforced good habits in **symbolic programming**, **assert-driven debugging**, and **compiler preprocessing**.
