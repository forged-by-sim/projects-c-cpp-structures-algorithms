# 🧠 C & C++ Projects – Systems Thinking, Algorithms & Simulation  
**Folder**: `projects-c-cpp-structures-algorithms`  
**Focus**: Developing structured systems and simulation-based logic using C and modern C++

⸻

## 🧭 Overview  
This repo documents my complete transition from low-level procedural logic in C to structured, simulation-ready systems in C++. I began by mastering the mechanics of control flow, memory layout, and pointers, and then scaled into **graph algorithms**, **Monte Carlo evaluation**, and **object-oriented simulation design** using modern C++.

Each project area captures a clear phase in my technical growth—combining performance thinking, algorithmic strategy, and clean system design. I’ve prioritized not just working code, but thoughtful breakdowns, performance tradeoff reflections, and readable structure across all implementations.

🧰 Tools & Languages:
- `C`, `C++`, STL containers (`vector`, `set`, `pair`)
- Class design, inheritance, and `std::move`
- Dijkstra’s algorithm, Min-Max logic, Monte Carlo simulations
- GitHub for version control and markdown reflections

## 💡 Reflection  

This project set helped transform me from someone who “wrote code” into someone who **designs systems**. I learned to think about memory layout, performance tradeoffs, and how to simulate real-world behaviors using clean, logical structures.

It wasn’t just about getting the right answer. It was about writing **scalable**, **modular**, and **justifiable** logic—from scratch.

I now approach simulation, embedded logic, and XR system development with a foundation in **true systems thinking**—and a C/C++ toolkit to back it up.
