🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced control flow in C—covering conditional branching (if, switch), iteration (while, for), logical operators, and function basics. The goal was to practice writing structured, reusable, and conditionally responsive programs that follow precise logic paths.

💻 Assignments Completed
✅ Fix Dr. P’s Mistake (Week 3)

Challenge: Continue the weekly debugging tradition by fixing another flawed C program.

What I Did:

Identified control-flow bugs.

Repaired if-else logic and conditional syntax.

Deepened understanding of how miswritten comparisons cause cascading issues in logic execution.

✅ While Loops

Challenge: Apply while loops to solve logical iteration problems.

What I Did:

Solved problems in While loop questions.txt.

Used WhileLoops_thought_process.md to pre-plan logic.

Practiced using loop counters and conditional exits.

✅ Switch Statements

Challenge: Practice writing and reasoning through switch control structures.

What I Did:

Wrote responses in Switch questions.txt after sketching logic in switch_thought_process.md.

Handled default branches, fall-through logic, and matched character cases.

✅ Logical Operators

Challenge: Strengthen logic by solving truth table puzzles and combining conditions.

What I Did:

Completed Logic operators quiz.txt, evaluating &&, ||, and ! operations.

Explored how to combine multiple conditions within if statements.

✅ Conditional and Comma Operators

Challenge: Investigate more advanced or less-used operators, such as the ternary (? :) and comma (,) operators.

What I Did:

Analyzed how the comma operator evaluates in sequence.

Completed Cond-comma-ops quiz.txt and wrote logic walkthroughs in Cond-comma-ops_thought_process.md.

✅ Loop Operators

Challenge: Evaluate and compare while, do-while, and for loop structures.

What I Did:

Compared loop types and their use cases in LoopOperators_thought_process.md.

Simulated loop execution in written logic walkthroughs.

✅ Function Practice – Sine & Cosine Table

Challenge: Create a table of sine and cosine values using functions and looped print statements.

What I Did:

Wrote sine_cosine_table_with_comments.c to generate a clean table.

Practiced integrating #include <math.h> and correct format specifiers.

Reflected in sine_cosine_table.txt on accuracy, rounding, and control flow.

✅ Extra – Changing Sine and Absolute Value

Challenge: Write a quick implementation to manipulate sin() and abs() outputs dynamically.

What I Did:

Used changing_sin_and_abs.c to reinforce flow-of-control patterns.

Built confidence chaining math operations with logical control.

🔍 Reflection

Module 3 deepened my control over how programs flow. I practiced switching between conditions, handling truth-based logic, and building loops with intention. Writing out thought processes before coding helped me debug and understand code behavior on a deeper level. This module marked the turning point where C started to feel more like a tool I could bend to my will rather than something I had to wrestle with. Every quiz and exercise contributed to more confident logic structuring and function-based thinking.
