🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced the fundamental lexical components of the C programming language—keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, delimiters—and how data types and expressions are used in combination to produce reliable computations. The focus was on understanding how C interprets tokens and evaluating expressions using static and dynamic methods.

💻 Assignments Completed
✅ Fix Dr. P’s Mistake – Week 2

Challenge: Correct another intentionally broken C program provided by "Dr. P", this time focused on variable types and expression syntax.

What I Did:

Fixed type mismatches and missing semicolons.

Validated output using integer-based expressions.

Reinforced understanding of how C interprets data declarations.

✅ Expression Thought Process

Challenge: Demonstrate how arithmetic expressions are evaluated and what type each value results in.

What I Did:

Reflected on the order of operations and C’s rules for type conversion and promotion.

Wrote out a markdown file (Expressions_thought_process.md) to explain my logic before coding.

Practiced interpreting complex expressions on paper before translating them into code.

✅ Volume of a Sphere

Challenge: Write a C program to calculate the volume of a sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * π * r³.

What I Did:

Used float and double precision types.

Practiced #define or manual declarations for π.

Reinforced the importance of type casting (e.g., 4.0/3) to avoid integer division issues.

✅ Sine Calculation – Static vs. Dynamic

Challenge: Explore how static constants differ from runtime values by calculating sine values two different ways.

What I Did:

Created sin_calc.c using math.h for runtime calculations.

Built module2_sine_static.c to use a fixed sine approximation.

Observed the accuracy difference between dynamic vs hardcoded values.

✅ Integer Type Quiz

Challenge: A mini quiz to reinforce understanding of how C handles int data types and expressions.

What I Did:

Completed the quiz in int quiz.txt, walking through mental evaluation of operations.

Confirmed results using print statements and trial runs in VS Code.

🔍 Reflection

This module solidified my grasp on how C interprets tokens, values, and types. I became more confident handling data type declarations, debugging expressions, and ensuring precision in calculations. It also introduced me to static vs dynamic evaluation, which plays a foundational role in performance-oriented applications. The quiz and reflection files gave me a chance to articulate logic before and after code execution, building better habits in programming thought.
