🎯 Course Objective

This course provided a foundational understanding of the C programming language, emphasizing procedural programming, memory awareness, and efficient low-level logic. It was my first formal exposure to the mechanics of the C language, including structured program flow, variable declarations, function definitions, and data types.

🧩 Modules Completed

Module 1: Basics of C Programming
Covered data types, printf, and arithmetic. I started building confidence in program structure and syntax.

Module 2: Conditionals, Logic, and Flow Control
Focused on if/else, logical operators, and user input/output. It also taught me how to safely handle edge cases.

Module 3: Loops and Iteration Patterns
Introduced while, do-while, and for loops. Helped me practice designing control flow for repetitive tasks.

Module 4: Advanced Functions, Recursion, Arrays, and Pointers
Although it didn’t include code assignments, it deepened my theoretical understanding of recursion, memory allocation, and function behavior.

✅ Assignments Overview

This course contained programming assignments in Modules 1 through 3, including:

Basic arithmetic and output tasks

Writing conditional logic programs

Creating iterative loop structures to solve structured problems

All assignments were implemented in standard C using VS Code and tracked in my GitHub repo with clear file names and accompanying breakdowns.

🪞Personal Reflection

Starting this course reminded me how close to the metal C programming really is. Even simple tasks forced me to slow down and think like the compiler: how memory is allocated, how variables are scoped, and how functions communicate. Every assignment challenged me to be exact, careful, and logical—there’s no guessing in C. This course laid a strong mental foundation that would prove invaluable as I transitioned into more advanced concepts in later C++ courses.
