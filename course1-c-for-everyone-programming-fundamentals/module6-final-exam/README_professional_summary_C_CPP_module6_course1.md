🔍 Reflection
Instead of rushing through the final, I chose to treat it like a problem-solving lab. I wrote out my logic and reasoning as I worked through each question. This method helped clarify areas I had initially misunderstood and reinforced my ability to trace control flow, pointer behavior, and operator precedence. Finishing the exam felt like stitching together all the tools I’d gained in Modules 1–5 into a final showcase of understanding.
