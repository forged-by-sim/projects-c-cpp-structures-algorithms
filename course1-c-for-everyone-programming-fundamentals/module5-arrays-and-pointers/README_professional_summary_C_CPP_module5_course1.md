🧠 Objective of the Module
This module introduced how C manages sequences of data using arrays and how it leverages pointers for direct memory access. I learned how arrays are declared, indexed, passed into functions, and traversed using loop structures. The module also covered pointer syntax, memory referencing/dereferencing, and simulated call-by-reference. Advanced topics included sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort) and understanding how pointers enable efficient data manipulation.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Array + Pointer Practice
Challenge: Understand how arrays and pointers relate in memory, and how to manipulate data efficiently.

What I Did:
 • Declared and initialized arrays for numerical data.
 • Accessed array elements using both indexing and pointer arithmetic.
 • Passed arrays into functions to analyze memory behavior.

⸻

✅ Simulate Call-by-Reference
Challenge: Use pointers to simulate reference-style behavior for functions in C.

What I Did:
 • Practiced passing addresses instead of values.
 • Modified values directly inside functions using dereferenced pointers.
 • Observed how this method avoids unnecessary data copying.

⸻

✅ Bubble Sort and Merge Sort
Challenge: Implement common sorting techniques using arrays and loop constructs.

What I Did:
 • Reviewed bubble sort and merge sort code in array-bubble-sort code and merge code example.
 • Learned how to split and merge arrays recursively.
 • Noted how memory efficiency and recursion play a role in sorting.

⸻

✅ Graded Assignment – Elephant Seal Weight Average
Challenge: Compute the average weight of a population of elephant seals using arrays.

What I Did:
 • Read in a set of integer values into an array.
 • Calculated cumulative sum and divided by length to find the average.
 • Used float casting to prevent truncation and ensure accurate output.
 • Submitted elephant_seal_average.c and received a 90%.

🔍 Reflection
Module 5 was where C finally revealed its deeper power. I started thinking in terms of memory, not just syntax. Understanding that an array is essentially a pointer to a block of memory changed how I approached iteration, function design, and optimization. Writing sorting logic showed me how important careful indexing and memory management is in C — one wrong pointer or loop index can collapse everything. This module made me more confident handling low-level operations and solidified my understanding of function calls, recursion, and memory handling.
