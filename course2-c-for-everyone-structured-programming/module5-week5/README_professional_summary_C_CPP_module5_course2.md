Grade: 100% on Quiz

📌 Overview

Module 5 served as a concise but important pivot from C to C++, introducing core C++ syntax and features. While short, it helped establish a foundational understanding of how structured programming in C can evolve into object-oriented approaches using C++ classes. The content emphasized the easier syntax, streamlined memory handling, and modularity offered by C++.

🎓 What I Learned

Differences between C and C++: Including syntax changes and streamlined I/O.

C++ Program Flow: Writing and understanding a simple C++ program.

C++ ADT Implementation: How classes can be used to encapsulate data and functions.

Ease of Use in C++: Features like constructors, member functions, and better encapsulation simplify certain programming tasks compared to C.

🧠 Reflections

This was a light but refreshing final module before the course exam. It highlighted how far I’d come in understanding structured programming and showed a glimpse of the object-oriented journey ahead. While I didn’t complete any code-based assignments here, the shift to C++ felt natural thanks to the foundation built throughout the course.
