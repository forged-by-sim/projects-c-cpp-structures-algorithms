🎯 Course Objective

This course built directly on the fundamentals of Course 1, guiding me into structured programming practices using C. It emphasized designing programs that are modular, reusable, and readable—crucial for scaling real-world systems. The biggest leap was not just writing code that works, but writing code that makes sense to someone else (or future me).

🧩 Modules Completed

Module 1: Structuring Code with Functions
I learned how to break large programs into manageable functions, enabling cleaner and more logical workflows.

Module 2: File I/O, Strings, and Data Flow
Taught me how to read from and write to files using fopen, fgets, fprintf, and related C standard functions.

Module 3: Arrays of Structs and Real‑World Examples
I implemented more complex data structures by combining arrays and struct, allowing me to simulate more realistic use cases like record keeping and basic simulations.

Module 4: Multi-File Programming and Header Files
I learned how to organize C programs across multiple files using header files for declarations and .c files for implementations. This module introduced best practices for modular programming, including the use of include guards and separate compilation, giving me a more professional understanding of how larger software projects are structured.

Module 5: Abstraction, Testing, and Integration
I applied everything I had learned in a structured program that emphasized abstraction and modularity. By combining file I/O, struct arrays, and multi-file logic, I built a complete system that could process and display data cleanly. This capstone-style module helped me think in systems rather than just snippets of code.

Module 6: Final Exam
The final module wrapped up the course with a project-based final exam that challenged me to synthesize everything from functions and arrays to file I/O and complexity considerations.

💻 Assignments Completed

Throughout this course, I built multiple C programs that demonstrated structured programming concepts. Highlights included:

Writing functions to modularize input validation, calculation, and output

Reading data from files and transforming it into structured output

Using arrays of struct to simulate multi‑record data processing

Designing a simple simulation that required managing state and behavior across multiple variables and loops

Final exam materials were submitted as .txt and .c files and are documented in the corresponding module4-final-exam folder.

🪞Personal Reflection

Course 2 was where I started feeling like a real programmer. Instead of just solving small logic problems, I was now building end‑to‑end applications with meaningful input/output, file persistence, and reusable code blocks. I became comfortable navigating longer files and breaking problems into smaller, testable components. This course also gave me the confidence to debug independently, trust my process, and think in systems, not just snippets. It set the stage for everything that came next in C++.
