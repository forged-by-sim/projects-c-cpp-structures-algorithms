🧠 Overview

This module introduced two key concepts:

Tree Structures and Inorder Traversal, allowing me to simulate hierarchical data traversal.

Rational Array Operations via File Input, where I practiced reading data from text files and performing operations on rational numbers in structured arrays.

These exercises deepened my ability to model data structures dynamically and process input/output in a more organized and scalable format.

• Week_4_Assignment Breakdown.txt – Personal guide to walk through how I structured the logic

✅ Rational Array Operations from File Input (HONORS)
• Rational_Array_Operations_File Input.c – Parsed file-based rational number inputs into structured arrays and executed arithmetic operations
• rational_data.txt – Data source used to test functionality
• Sample Output.txt – Verified operation results
• HONORS_Week_4_Assignment Breakdown.txt – Explanation of logic, choices, and edge handling for this file-driven array challenge

✅ Weekly Quiz
• week_4_quiz.txt – Applied conceptual knowledge of trees, arrays, and file operations in code scenarios

🔍 Reflection

This was a lighter coding week, but a valuable one. I practiced core techniques for managing hierarchical and structured data — a foundational skill for algorithms, search engines, and simulations. The rational file input challenge mimicked real-world workflows, where datasets are processed from external files rather than hardcoded arrays. Each task taught me to write clean, efficient logic that could scale if expanded.
