🧠 Objective of the Module

This module extended the use of struct into linked list structures, culminating in a more complex understanding of dynamic memory management and data organization. The honors track focused on building a simulated periodic table, showcasing how structs can be layered, extended, and integrated with control logic to model more nuanced scientific data.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Main Assignment – Atomic Elements Using Structs
Challenge: Create and store atomic element data using struct and simulate outputs.

What I Did:
• Defined a struct to represent atomic elements including fields like name, atomic number, and mass.
• Implemented core logic in General.c and Hardcoded 10 Atomic Elements Stored as a struct.c.
• Planned out the design in step-by-step-plan for struct of atoms.txt.
• Previewed results in Sample_Output_atomic_elements.txt.
• Recorded guiding notes in Task for Week 3.txt.

⸻

✅ Honors Assignment – Dynamic Data with Duplicate Removal
Challenge: Build a doubly linked list that stores atomic element data and removes duplicates during insertion.

What I Did:
• Designed and implemented Doubly Linked List with Duplicate Removal v1.txt as a structural experiment.
• Created a companion breakdown in Assignment Breakdown for HONORS.txt explaining the logic flow.
• Used Struct to Store Atomic Elements.png as a visual schema to map how the struct was used in memory.
• Wrote Week 3 Honors Assignment.txt to summarize concepts and justify architectural decisions.

⸻

✅ Week 3 Quiz
Challenge: Test comprehension of linked lists, pointer manipulation, struct memory layout, and data modeling.

What I Did:
• Completed and documented responses in week_3_quiz.txt.
• Covered how to traverse, modify, and manage data in custom data structures.
• Applied both theoretical and practical understanding of structs in C.

🔍 Reflection

This module demanded a higher level of abstraction and design thinking. It was no longer just about making code work — it was about structuring it for scalability and clarity. I was especially proud of the doubly linked list logic and the ability to detect and remove duplicates during insertion. Modeling atomic elements made the abstract concrete, especially as I imagined each data point as a unique scientific entity. This week solidified my confidence with struct layering and pointer-based data manipulation.
