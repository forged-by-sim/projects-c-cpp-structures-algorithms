🧠 Objective of the Module

This module marked the culmination of everything I learned throughout the “C for Everyone: Structured Programming” course. The final exam tested a wide range of skills: data structures, conditionals, loops, modular functions, and conceptual comprehension of program structure. Unlike the earlier weekly quizzes, this exam required full integration of logic and code patterns I’ve been practicing for weeks. It wasn’t just about right answers—it was about clean logic, thoughtful decisions, and defensible reasoning under time pressure.

• Documented my reasoning and debugging process separately in course2-final-exam_thought-process.txt.
• Approached each question methodically—testing variables, checking edge cases, and applying techniques learned from prior modules.
• Used assertions and modular design principles where applicable.
• Missed only one minor item—reflected on it in my thought process notes.
• Submitted on time and scored 96.66% (as shown in Coursera dashboard).

🔍 Reflection

This module was a moment of synthesis—where all the fragmented pieces I’d been learning clicked into place. I didn’t just answer questions; I debugged, defended my logic, and thought like a structured programmer. Creating the separate thought process file was crucial—it helped me clarify my decision-making and catch small missteps before submission. Even though I didn’t score a perfect 100%, this felt like one of my strongest performances because I leaned on everything I’d learned: from assert logic to loop hygiene to modularity. I closed out this course with clarity and confidence.
