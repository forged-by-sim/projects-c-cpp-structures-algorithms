🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced user-defined structures (struct) to group related data types, along with a foray into basic simulation programming, including Monte Carlo methods. The learning focus was on how structs increase modularity in C programs and how simulations can model real-world randomness, particularly through statistical experiments like card games and probabilistic events.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Week 2 Assignment – Using struct
Challenge: Create a simple program that uses a struct to model an employee profile.

What I Did:
• Defined a struct with fields like name, ID, and salary.
• Implemented the solution in employee_generator.c and added employee_generator_explanatory_comments.c for clarity.
• Wrote a README_employee_generator.md to explain structure usage and logic.

⸻

✅ Week 2 Honors Assignment – Monte Carlo Simulation
Challenge: Simulate a poker-based experiment using Monte Carlo techniques.

What I Did:
• Built a simulation in HONORS_monte_carlo_poker_with_explanation.c.
• Tracked output and analysis in HONORS_monte_carlo_simulation_results.c and Probabilities in Table.png.
• Used months.txt and other seed data to generate randomized events.
• Reflected in Week 2 Honors Assignment.txt on the role of probability in simulation coding.

⸻

✅ Week 2 Quiz
Challenge: Reinforce key concepts from the lectures, such as struct syntax, memory layout, and probabilistic reasoning.

What I Did:
• Completed all questions in week_2_quiz.txt with contextual reasoning.
• Explored conceptual differences between arrays vs structs, as well as data encapsulation benefits.

🔍 Reflection

This module marked a leap in complexity and creativity. Structs unlocked the ability to model real-world entities with readable, organized code. Meanwhile, the Monte Carlo assignment opened my eyes to how randomness and probability can be coded into simulations. It was my first experience blending math and code for experimental modeling. The process of visualizing outcomes through .png exports and commented logic helped me connect theory with real implementation. Every file became part of a simulation lab where the logic of struct and chance danced together. I left this module more confident in organizing data and simulating reality in code.
