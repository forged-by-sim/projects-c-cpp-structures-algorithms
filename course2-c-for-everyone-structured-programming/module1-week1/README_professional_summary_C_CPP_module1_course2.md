🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced three powerful C language features that support maintainability and robustness: enumerated types (enum), the C preprocessor (#define, #include), and assertion-based debugging (assert()). These tools allow C programmers to create symbolic constants, preprocess logic, and implement runtime checks that catch logic errors during development. The focus was on understanding how each contributes to clean, readable, and defensive code.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Week 1 Quiz
Challenge: Apply conceptual understanding of enum, preprocessor directives, and assert functionality to real code snippets.

What I Did:
• Answered quiz questions directly in week_1_quiz.txt.
• Explored how enum allows more readable symbolic values versus magic numbers.
• Reviewed how #define and #include shape compilation and improve code modularity.
• Reinforced when and how to use assert() for runtime condition checks.
• Scored 100% on the quiz (as seen in the Coursera module dashboard).

🔍 Reflection

Module 1 served as a gentle but important bridge into structured programming. While not as hands-on as later modules, it provided theoretical and practical tools I now rely on constantly. Using enum helped replace unclear integer codes with self-documenting values. Preprocessor directives made the code cleaner and more manageable. And assert() gave me a simple tool for catching bugs during development before they snowball. This module planted the seeds for defensive programming, and my quiz responses served as both a confidence boost and a reinforcement of these key fundamentals.
