### ✅ Task 1: Elephant Seal Weight Average  
Challenge: Compute the average weight of a population of elephant seals using an array.

🧠 What I Did:
- Read a set of integers into an array  
- Calculated the cumulative sum and used the array length for averaging  
- Used float casting to prevent truncation and preserve precision  
- Submitted `elephant_seal_average.c` and earned a 90%

- Performing calculations over structured data  
- Preventing loss of precision using type casting  
- Practicing indexed iteration and memory layout awareness  
- Recognizing how data structure choices affect output and accuracy

## 🪞 Reflection  
This phase of C practice introduced me to arrays as pointers — not just syntax but memory behavior. By working through average calculations and observing how data lived in memory, I realized how easily missteps like poor indexing or integer division can derail accuracy. Understanding type casting, loop logic, and pointer fundamentals here made me more confident in how C manages memory, data, and function communication at a deeper level.
