# 🔁 M3 – Control Flow, Logical Reasoning & Sine-Based Functions  
**Folder**: `c1-c-basics-containers/m3`  
**Focus**: Designing conditional logic, iterative control flow, and math-based output using structured C programs

⸻

## 🧪 Projects Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Debug Control Flow Logic – *Fix Dr. P’s Mistake*  
Challenge: Repair a flawed C program containing control-flow and conditional logic errors.

🧠 What I Did:
- Identified faulty comparisons and conditional branches  
- Repaired `if-else` logic and corrected syntax issues  
- Traced execution paths to prevent cascading logic failures

---

### ✅ Task 2: Function-Based Table – *Sine & Cosine Output*  
Challenge: Generate a formatted table of sine and cosine values using functions and looped print statements.

📐 What I Did:
- Wrote `sine_cosine_table_between_0_and_1.c` to generate a clean table  
- Integrated `math.h` with loop-based output  
- Applied format specifiers for aligned numerical output

---

### ✅ Task 3: Absolute Value of Sine Over an Interval  
Challenge: Compute and display the absolute value of `sin(x)` across a fixed interval.

🧪 What I Did:
- Implemented `use-sine-absolute-print-interval.c` using `sin()` and `abs()`  
- Iterated over a numeric range using loop control  
- Printed formatted results for clear comparison across values

---

### ✅ Task 4: Extra – Changing Sine and Absolute Value Dynamically  
Challenge: Manipulate sine and absolute value outputs dynamically using control flow.

🔧 What I Did:
- Wrote `changing-sine-and-absolute.c` to reinforce flow-of-control patterns  
- Chained math operations with logical conditions  
- Built confidence combining functions, loops, and formatted output

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- Debugging conditional and branching logic  
- Structuring loop-driven numerical output  
- Integrating `math.h` functions into control flow  
- Formatting floating-point values consistently  
- Separating production tasks from exploratory practice

## 🪞 Reflection  
This stage reinforced how intentional control flow shapes program behavior. By generating structured math output and manipulating values across intervals, I learned to treat loops and conditions as design tools rather than trial-and-error constructs. Separating tasks from practice clarified the difference between deliverables and skill-building, strengthening both.
