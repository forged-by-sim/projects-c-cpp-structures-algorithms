🧪 M6 – Debugging & Memory Practice

Folder: m6-final-practice-debugging
Focus: Independent practice on pointer behavior, memory access, and debugging C programs

⸻

🎯 Overview

This solo practice session focused on deepening my understanding of how memory is handled in C, especially regarding pointers, address manipulation, and debugging techniques. I explored key logic breakdowns and tested edge cases that weren’t fully addressed in earlier tasks.

Topics reinforced:

Conditionals, loops, and operator precedence

Pointer behavior and memory referencing

Logic tracing and debugging thought processes

Integrating multiple core concepts into one problem-solving session

Control flow analysis

Syntax pitfalls and logic misfires

Reading compiler errors and debugging iteratively

🧠 Reflection

Finishing this logic lab felt like stitching together everything I’d practiced in earlier C projects. It clarified misunderstandings I didn’t know I had—like subtle pointer behavior or how operator precedence can affect results. Treating this like a lab instead of a test helped me retain more and boosted my confidence in independently debugging and reasoning through unfamiliar code.
