# 🔁 M4 – Recursive Thinking, Scope Control & C Function Behavior  
**Folder**: `c1-c-basics-containers/m4`  
**Focus**: Strengthening mental models of how C functions behave in memory, especially during recursion and variable storage

## 🧠 Core Concepts Revisited

This segment deepened my intuition for how **functions**, **recursion**, and **scope rules** work at a memory level in C. While there were no deliverables for this section, I treated it as a thought exercise—visualizing the call stack, tracing execution flow, and sketching how values are passed, stored, and retained.

Key areas of focus:
- **Function Visibility & Return Control** – Understanding how declarations, prototypes, and return types shape logic visibility  
- **Call-by-Value Mechanics** – Reframing how C handles argument passing, especially compared to higher-level languages  
- **Recursive Behavior** – Reinforcing mental models for recursion through factorial and Fibonacci flows  
- **Storage Classes** – Comparing `static`, `auto`, `register`, and `extern` for persistent vs temporary memory behavior

## 🪞 Reflection  

Even without coding tasks, this was a **valuable memory refresh**. I revisited topics I’ve struggled with in the past—especially recursion and memory tracing—and walked through them from a systems perspective. Visualizing the **stack frame**, drawing recursive trees, and thinking like the compiler helped demystify what happens under the hood.

📌 I plan to build a **Fibonacci function with memoization** soon to apply these ideas practically and bridge into C++ optimization techniques later.
