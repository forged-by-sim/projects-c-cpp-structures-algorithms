# 🧰 C Basics & Containers  
**Folder**: `c1-c-basics-containers`  
**Focus**: Core C programming logic, flow control, and memory-aware design  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This project introduced foundational concepts in the C language, emphasizing structured logic, memory awareness, and efficient program design. I worked with core control structures and explored how C handles data, branching, iteration, and system-level behavior.

Key topics explored:
- Data types (`int`, `float`, `char`) and variable declarations  
- Formatted output with `printf()`  
- Conditional branching using `if`, `else`, and logical operators  
- Control flow with `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops  
- Conceptual exploration of recursion, memory allocation, and pointers

## 🛠️ Featured Tasks  

✅ Performed arithmetic operations and formatted the output  
✅ Built logic-driven scripts using conditionals  
✅ Designed iterative solutions using loop structures  
🧠 Studied theoretical behavior of arrays, memory usage, and recursive logic  

All scripts were written in standard C using VS Code. Code is organized with clear filenames and inline comments, and tracked in version control for transparency.

## 💡 Reflection  
Working in C required a shift in mindset—every decision had to be deliberate. There was no guessing or hand-holding. I had to think like a compiler: track memory, scope variables, and plan control flow carefully. This project sharpened my precision and laid a solid foundation for deeper C++ development and systems programming down the line.
