# 🧮 M4 – File-Based MST Construction with Prim’s Algorithm  
**Folder**: `c3-cpp-graphs-dijkstras-algorithms/m4`  
**Focus**: Parsing graph data from a file and applying Prim’s algorithm to compute a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## 🧾 Task: Build MST from File-Based Graph Input

**Goal**:  
Read graph data from an external file, construct a weighted adjacency matrix in C++, and apply Prim’s algorithm to generate the graph’s minimum spanning tree.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Outlined my logic in `task-breakdown-minimum-spanning-tree-file-based-graph-input.txt`  
- Converted that plan into actionable steps and pseudocode in `prompt-compute-minimum-spanning-tree-for-inputted-graph.txt`  
- Implemented the full solution in `file-based-constructor-and-prim.cpp`, building the graph matrix dynamically from a file  
- Iteratively selected the minimum edge using Prim’s logic and validated MST construction  
- Focused on correct file handling, edge selection, and matrix population

## 🪞 Reflection

This task pushed me from pure algorithm design into real-world simulation logic—working with file input, matrix construction, and dynamic memory. It emphasized why file-based graph handling is critical for scalable systems and taught me how to apply algorithms beyond static code. Watching the MST emerge from external input made the power of Prim’s algorithm feel tangible, and I now feel more confident working with data-driven architectures in C++.
