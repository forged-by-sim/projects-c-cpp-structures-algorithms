# 📍 M3 – Graph Simulation Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
**Folder**: `c3-cpp-graphs-dijkstras-algorithms/m3`  
**Focus**: Simulating a shortest-path graph traversal using Dijkstra’s algorithm in C++

## 📌 Task: Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm in C++

**Goal**:  
Simulate a basic graph and implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path from a given starting node to all other nodes. Use 2D arrays to track distances, visited nodes, and path updates dynamically.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Broke down the problem in `task-breakdown-implement-dijkstra-algorithm.txt` to clarify the algorithm’s sequence  
- Wrote out pseudocode and structural notes in `prompt-implement-dijkstra-algorithm-simulation.txt`  
- Implemented the full solution in `dijkstra-graph-simulation.cpp` using a 2D matrix to model the graph  
- Simulated distance updates, visited-node tracking, and applied proper edge relaxation logic  
- Validated outputs by testing known graph patterns and confirming expected shortest paths

## 🪞 Reflection

This was one of the most technical and rewarding tasks in the C++ series. Translating Dijkstra’s algorithm from theory into executable logic helped sharpen my understanding of graph traversal, distance initialization, and indexing strategies. Working step-by-step in text files first gave me a roadmap for clean and efficient implementation. Watching the simulation correctly compute shortest paths felt like a major milestone in my algorithmic thinking.
