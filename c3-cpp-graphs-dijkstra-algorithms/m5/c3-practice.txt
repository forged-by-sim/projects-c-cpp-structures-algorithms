FOR QUESTIONS 1-5 REFER TO THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES AND INITIALIZATIONS:

   int a = 2, b = -3, c = 2; 

   bool tval1 = false, tval2 = true;

   char ch = ‘b’;

Assume each evaluation is legal and occurs immediately after this declaration.

What is the value of the following expression? 

b + c * a

==> Answer is 1

c % 5/2

==> Answer is 1 

-a * c++

==> Answer is -4

tval1 && tval2

==> Answer is false 

ch += 2

==> Answer is 'd'


6. What did D. Ritchie do?
==> All of the above 


7. What did B. Stroustrup do?
==> invented C++


8. What did E. Dijkstra invent?
==> shortest path algorithm


9. What did L. Euler invent? 
==> graph theory


10. printin is a keyword in C++11.
==> False


11. In the expression f(1) || (!g(2)), and without knowing the return types of f(1) and g(2), you can still assert that f(1) will always be evaluated before g(2) (which may not get evaluated at all). 
==> True 



FOR QUESTIONS 12–16 REFER TO THE FOLLOWING:

Answer number that is returned by mystery() for each answer in printout.

//templates what gets printed

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

template <class T1, class T2>

int mystery(T1& a, T2 b, int c)

{

      T1 t = a;

      a = a + b;

      return ( a - t + c);

}
int main(void)

{

      int a = 3;

      double b = 2.5;

      int c = 1;

      cout << " answer 1 is  " << mystery(a, 2, c) << endl;

      cout << " answer 2 is  " << mystery(a, 1, c) << endl;

      a = 5;

      cout << " answer 3 is  " << mystery(a, b, c) << endl;

      a = 2; 

      b = 2.5;

      cout << " answer 4 is  " << mystery(a, b, b) << endl;

      cout << " answer 5 is  " << mystery(a,mystery(a, b, b),c)<< endl;

      return 0;

}



12. Answer 1 is 3

13. Answer 2 is 2

14. Answer 3 is 3

15. Answer 4 is 4

16. Answer 5 is 5

18. What is the cost of its maximum spanning tree?
==> 30


19. What is the shortest path cost from node 0 to node 2?
==> 9

    {

        vector<int> data(5,1);

        int sum {0};

    cout << sum << endl;

        for(auto element : data)

             sum += element;

        cout << sum << endl;

    for(auto p = ++data.begin(); p != --data.end(); ++p)
sum += *p;

        cout << sum << endl;

        sum = 0;

        data.push_back(2);

        data.push_back(3);

        for(auto element : data)

             sum += element;

        cout << sum << endl;

    cout << accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), data[0]) << endl;
