# 🧪 M5 – Practice Task: Final C++ Logic & Algorithmic Reasoning  
**Folder**: `c3-cpp-graphs-dijkstras-algorithms/m5`  
**Files**: `c3-practice.txt`, `c3_practice_thought_process.md`  
**Focus**: Synthesizing C++ logic, graph theory, STL usage, and probability reasoning under final-exam-style pressure

## 🎯 Task Overview  
This segment acted as the **final checkpoint** for Course 3. The tasks were designed to mirror a C++ logic and reasoning exam—testing STL mastery, algorithmic tradeoffs, probability evaluation, and edge-case validation. 

I completed each written task in `c3-practice.txt`, then documented the full reasoning and logic flow in `c3_practice_thought_process.md`. The goal wasn’t just to solve the problems—it was to demonstrate clarity, justification, and fluency in C++ decision-making under pressure.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- STL containers and algorithm behavior (e.g., vectors, iterators, `push_back`, `.begin()`, etc.)  
- Probability tradeoffs, edge behavior, and runtime complexity  
- Reconstructing Dijkstra-style logic in theory-based questions  
- Algorithmic justifications and reasoning clarity  
- Emulating technical interview-style written problem solving

| File Name                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `c3-practice.txt`           | Final exam-style tasks with written responses and code-logic explanations   |
| `c3_practice_thought_process.md` | Full breakdown of logic paths, assumptions, and decision checkpoints        |

Together, these files solidified my algorithmic thinking and tested how well I could apply C++ design patterns without a compiler. It felt like a true capstone for my STL fluency and abstract reasoning in technical C++ interviews.
