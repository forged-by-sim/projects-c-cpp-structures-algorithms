## 🛠️ Task: Convert a Procedural C Program to C++

**Goal**:  
Reimplement a functioning C program in C++ using modern syntax and formatting conventions. Replace C-style input/output with `cin` and `cout`, and apply modular thinking for long-term code extensibility.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Analyzed the original C logic and broke down the problem into manageable conversion steps  
- Drafted a plan to transition C constructs to idiomatic C++  
- Replaced `printf`/`scanf` with `cout`/`cin`, and added formatting enhancements  
- Refactored the structure slightly to align with clearer C++ standards  
- Validated the final output to ensure functional parity with the original program

## 🪞 Reflection

This task was more than just swapping syntax—it was about learning how C++ encourages modular, readable, and extensible design. Writing a plan before jumping into the code helped clarify my logic and made debugging easier. I’m beginning to see how C++ lays the foundation for more robust programming habits and long-term maintainability.
