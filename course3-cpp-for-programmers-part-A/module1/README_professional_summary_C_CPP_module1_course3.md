🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced the fundamentals of C++ programming by bridging from the C foundation I had built in previous courses. The key objective was to understand what makes C++ different from C—specifically its emphasis on objects, stronger type safety, and improved abstraction capabilities. We reviewed the structure of a basic C++ program, explored how to handle input/output with cin and cout, and began converting procedural C code into more readable and modular C++ syntax.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Homework 1 – Convert a C Program to C++
Challenge: Take a working C program and reimplement it in C++ syntax using appropriate I/O and structural adjustments.

What I Did:
• Read the problem statement and unpacked the requirements in Homework_1_Assignment_Breakdown.txt.
• Wrote my plan of action and conversion notes in Homework_1_Convert a C program to CPP.txt.
• Created the final .cpp implementation as HW1_Converted to C++ program.cpp, replacing printf/scanf with cout/cin, and ensuring the code adhered to C++ standards.
• Included a supplemental reference PDF (The random library-2018.pdf) to refresh on C++ features for future modules.

🔍 Reflection

This module eased me into the world of C++ by allowing me to rework something familiar—a procedural C program—and reinterpret it using new syntax and slightly different logic. It wasn’t just about cout and cin—it was about starting to think differently: more modularly, more abstractly. I took the time to write out my thought process before jumping into code, and that preparation paid off. It felt like opening a door to more powerful programming approaches, and I’m excited to lean further into object-oriented design in future modules.
