🧠 Objective of the Module

The goal of this module was to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm in C++—a classic shortest-path algorithm used in graph theory and real-world applications like GPS navigation systems. This assignment tested both my understanding of algorithm design and my ability to manage C++ syntax for more complex data structures like vectors and 2D arrays. The focus was on applying the algorithm step-by-step and verifying its output with a simulated graph.

✅ Homework 2 – Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Challenge: Build a graph simulation using C++ that implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes.

What I Did:
• Began with a clear assignment outline in Homework_2_Assignment Breakdown.txt.
• Sketched out the algorithm and wrote high-level pseudocode in Homework_2_Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm.txt.
• Wrote a full simulation in HW2_Dijkstra Graph Simulation.cpp where I built a graph as a 2D matrix, initialized distances, tracked visited nodes, and updated paths dynamically.
• I tested the logic carefully to ensure correct distance outputs and proper edge relaxation.

🔍 Reflection

This was one of the most technical modules so far, and it gave me a chance to dive into real-world algorithmic thinking. Translating the theoretical steps of Dijkstra into working C++ logic made me appreciate how important it is to plan before you code. I made sure to break down the logic in text files first, so my .cpp file was more of an execution than an experiment. This assignment taught me to respect edge cases, initialization, and indexing—especially when dealing with graphs and matrices. It was incredibly satisfying to see the shortest path distances display correctly in the end.
