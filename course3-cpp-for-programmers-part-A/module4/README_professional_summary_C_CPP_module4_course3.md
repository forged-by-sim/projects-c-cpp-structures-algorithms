🧠 Objective of the Module

This module focused on computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph using Prim’s algorithm, but with a new twist—reading the graph data from a file instead of hardcoding it. The emphasis was on building a file parser in C++, constructing a weighted adjacency matrix, and then implementing Prim’s algorithm to compute the MST. This simulated how data might be processed in real-world applications like network design or infrastructure optimization.

✅ Homework 3 – File-Based Graph Constructor and Prim's Algorithm
Challenge: Read a graph from an external file, build a corresponding internal data structure, and apply Prim’s algorithm to compute its MST.

What I Did:
• Mapped out my strategy in Homework_3_Assignment Breakdown.txt.
• Documented my algorithm design and data parsing logic in Homework_3_Compute the minimum spanning tree for an inputted graph.txt.
• Developed and tested the full implementation in HW3_File based constructor and Prim.cpp, which reads a file line-by-line to build the adjacency matrix, selects the minimum edge at each step, and builds the MST iteratively.
• Paid special attention to file reading syntax, matrix construction, and edge selection logic.

🔍 Reflection

This module challenged me to move from algorithm design into data ingestion and practical file I/O—something many beginner-level courses don’t touch. Writing code that could dynamically build a graph from a file made the experience feel more “real-world” and professional. I now understand why file-based constructors are so important, especially when dealing with external datasets. Prim’s algorithm became much more tangible once I saw it calculate an actual MST from file input. This was the final building block of the course, and it made me feel confident in my ability to handle more complex simulation logic and file-driven architectures.
