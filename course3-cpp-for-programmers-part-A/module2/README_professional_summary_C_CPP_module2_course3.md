🎯 Objective

This module introduced key C++ concepts through the lens of graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving. Using generics and custom data types, I explored how to model graph structures and apply classic algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path. Though lecture-based, this module expanded my object-oriented thinking and showed how C++ types can be engineered for clarity, reusability, and control over abstraction.

🧩 Topics Covered

• C++ Generics and Functions
I learned how to define generic functions using templates and how multiple template arguments can be used to create flexible, reusable algorithms.

• Graph Theory and Data Structures
The videos covered how to represent graphs as adjacency lists, and how those structures are built and traversed in C++.

• Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
The core algorithm was broken down in a way that highlighted how edge weights and node distances are stored and updated through priority-based exploration.

• Creating Types & Enums
I explored how to define custom types and enums, particularly for organizing logic like the "days of the week" example. Operator overloading was touched on as a way to control behavior between objects.

• Typed Widgets & Class: Point
The final sections walked through class design using Point as an example. This included constructors, method overloading, and foundational object-oriented principles in C++.

📌 No Assignments

There were no hands-on assignments in this module. All learning was delivered through lecture content. As a result, the corresponding GitHub folder is intentionally empty and serves as a placeholder for documentation only.

🪞Personal Reflection

This module helped me bridge the gap between procedural logic in C and abstract modeling in C++. It clarified why templates are so powerful in algorithm design — allowing a single function or class to work with different data types. Seeing Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented from scratch solidified my grasp on both graph traversal and weighted pathfinding. I plan to recreate this algorithm using my own structure and data types in a future module or project.
