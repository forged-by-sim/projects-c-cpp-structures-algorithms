🧠 Objective of the Module

This module introduced the concept of using graphs and object-oriented inheritance to model complex game logic—in this case, a Hex game board. I expanded my understanding of how inheritance can be used to build upon existing classes, reusing and extending their functionality for specialized purposes. I also learned how to represent a board as a graph structure, an important step in moving from procedural programming to designing software with modular and extensible architecture.

💻 Assignments Completed

✅ Implement Hex Board
Challenge: Construct a Hex game board using graph-based logic and object-oriented principles.

What I Did:
• Designed and implemented the Hex board logic in HW4_Hex Board.cpp.
• Wrote out a step-by-step breakdown of my implementation strategy in Homework 4_Assignment Breakdown.txt.
• Reflected on core OOP concepts—inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation—in Homework 1(4)_Implement Hex Board.txt.
• Carefully debugged edge cases such as connection checking and move legality.
• Ensured modularity and reusability by defining clean class structures.

🔍 Reflection

This assignment was my first time blending game logic with graph theory, and it challenged me to think beyond simple conditionals and loops. Designing a board that could be treated as a graph required more abstract thinking—particularly when implementing functions that simulate connection pathways between nodes. I felt especially proud of how cleanly I used inheritance to extend existing class structures. Although the implementation was dense, writing detailed breakdowns along the way helped clarify my thinking. This module felt like a bridge between academic theory and real-world systems thinking.
