🎯 Objective

In this module, I dove into two advanced C++ concepts: AI-driven game strategy using Min-Max algorithms (and Alpha-Beta pruning), and C++11 move semantics to optimize object transfers. The content focused on boosting both computational logic and memory efficiency — essential when writing performance-driven code like game engines or simulations.

🧩 Topics Covered
➤ C++ Class Constructors & Move Semantics

I started by reviewing how to define and use constructors in C++, then explored move constructors introduced in C++11. I learned how std::move allows resource ownership to be transferred without deep copying, which is vital in memory-sensitive applications.

Creating C++11 Classes

Initializer Lists & Extended Constructors

Move Constructor Logic & std::move Implementation

➤ AI Logic for Game Decision-Making

I learned how to simulate intelligent decisions in turn-based games by using the Min-Max algorithm and its optimized variant, Alpha-Beta pruning. This strategy is based on predicting future moves and pruning paths that don’t affect the outcome, greatly improving performance.

➤ Inheritance in Expression Evaluation

I wrapped up the module by using object-oriented techniques to parse and evaluate expressions written in Polish notation (prefix form). Using inheritance and abstract base classes, I built a tree structure capable of evaluating mathematical expressions recursively.

Referential Garbage Collection

Abstract Base Classes with Pure Virtual Functions

📌 No Assignments

There were no coding assignments or quizzes in this module. The focus was purely on conceptual mastery through guided video instruction. I still took personal notes and plan to recreate some of the class structures and Min-Max logic in my free time for reinforcement.

🪞 Personal Reflection

This module was dense but rewarding. The AI portion made me think like a strategist, while the move constructor section showed me how to write smarter, faster code. Although there were no assignments, I took the opportunity to pause frequently and sketch out how I would implement some of these patterns in my own projects. It gave me a clearer understanding of how inheritance, memory management, and optimization converge in advanced C++ workflows.
