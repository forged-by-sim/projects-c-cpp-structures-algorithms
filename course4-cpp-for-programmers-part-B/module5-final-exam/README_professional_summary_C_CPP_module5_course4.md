🧠 Objective of the Module

This final module concluded Part B of the C++ For C Programmers specialization. It served as both an assessment and a consolidation of the most advanced topics explored throughout the course—such as Monte Carlo simulation, Hex game logic, STL-based game modeling, and class-driven system design. The exam tested my ability to integrate these topics into clean, efficient C++ code and logical decision-making.

✅ Final Exam – Graded (100%)

Challenge: Demonstrate mastery over advanced simulation techniques, probability evaluation, STL patterns, and dynamic gameplay systems using C++.

What I Did:

Completed the written portion and supporting code implementation in course4-final-exam.txt.

Documented my test strategy and reasoning for each question inside course4-final-exam_thought-process.txt.

Applied Monte Carlo logic to evaluate board states and predict optimal outcomes.

Used STL structures and object-oriented design to streamline game logic.

Debugged and re-evaluated several decisions based on performance tradeoffs and class design principles.

Verified my final answers against game outcomes and probabilistic expectations.

Earned a perfect 100% on the final, confirming both conceptual and practical fluency in simulation-based C++ programming.

🔍 Reflection

This exam was the most simulation-heavy challenge of the entire C/C++ series. It required not just algorithmic clarity, but an ability to model and reason through complex systems like an interactive game board. I had to think probabilistically and iteratively, not just deterministically. My Hex Monte Carlo simulation skills were put to the test—and they held up under pressure.

Most rewarding was the realization that I now approach C++ design with structure, confidence, and rigor. My answers weren’t just functional—they were efficient, scalable, and justified with clear mental models. This capstone affirmed that I’ve completed the specialization not just as a student, but as a capable and resilient simulation-focused C++ programmer.
