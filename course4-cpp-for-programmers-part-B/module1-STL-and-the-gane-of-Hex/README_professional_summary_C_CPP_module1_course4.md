🎯 Objective

In this module, I explored how to apply fundamental graph concepts using C++ and the Standard Template Library. The focus was on understanding how graph-based problems can be tackled through STL constructs, especially when working with adjacency lists, sets, and vectors. I also got to revisit key algorithmic patterns in the context of modern C++.

🧩 Topics Covered

Introduction to Graphs:
I revisited graph theory basics—nodes, edges, adjacency relationships—then shifted toward implementation using C++ containers.

STL Containers for Graphs:
I explored std::vector, std::set, and std::pair to model adjacency lists efficiently. The emphasis was on writing clean, modular code and using STL iterators effectively.

Graph Traversals & Representation:
While there was no deep dive into DFS/BFS here, the foundation for future modules was set by showcasing how STL supports dynamic, container-based traversal and graph building.

📌 No Assignments

There were no assignments in this module. All learning was video-based and concept-driven, focusing on graph representation with STL rather than on interactive coding tasks.

🪞Personal Reflection

Even without hands-on assignments, I found this module refreshing. It gave me the space to mentally connect graph theory concepts I’ve learned in the past with C++ implementations using STL. I appreciated the clean, efficient code patterns demonstrated — they reinforced my ability to think like a systems-level programmer. I’m planning to recreate a basic undirected graph builder using std::vector<std::set<int>> as a personal mini-project.
