🧠 Objective of the Module

This final module in the specialization challenged me to implement a simplified Monte Carlo strategy for evaluating Hex moves—a perfect culmination of everything I’ve learned in C++. The focus was on fusing graph logic, advanced OOP patterns, and simulation-based evaluation into one cohesive program. It tested not only my technical fluency but also my ability to write modular, extensible code capable of intelligent decision-making.

✅ Implement Monte Carlo Hex Move Evaluation
Challenge: Apply a Monte Carlo-based move evaluation strategy to the Hex game logic using C++.

What I Did:
• Created a full simulation system for Monte Carlo-based decision-making in HW5_Interactive Hex Game.cpp.
• Reflected on my implementation in Homework 2(5)_Implement Monte Carlo Hex Move Eval.txt.
• Documented my development logic and OOP design considerations in Homework 5_Assignment Breakdown.txt.
• Used random simulations, weighted decisions, and inheritance patterns to bring intelligent behavior to the game.
• Focused on memory safety, logic clarity, and reusability.

🔍 Reflection

This was one of the most intellectually satisfying modules I’ve completed so far. Writing a Monte Carlo Hex evaluator from scratch pushed me to synthesize randomness, probability, and logic in a way that felt both technical and creative. I finally saw how object-oriented patterns can be used not just to organize code but to bring it to life. The final result was a playable, intelligent version of Hex—and I built it from the ground up. I walked away from this project feeling like I truly earned the "for programmers" badge in this specialization.
